Student Name: Charles Laverick

This project is a flask web application for a study planner that allows the user to create modules and tasks for those modules to track progress as well as the ability to view them on a calendar.

## Running the App
The run.py file should work but just incase there is also a command line way to run the Flask app.

If the run.py file does not work then to run the flask application instead you first have to set a couple environment variables using the following commands:

(Command Prompt)

set FLASK_APP=StudyPlanner

set FLASK_DEBUG=True

To run simply use the following command:

flash run


## Useful Commands
Use in command prompt:

set FLASK_APP=StudyPlanner

set FLASK_DEBUG=True

flash run

flask shell
